# 100DaysOfCodePython
My journey to code for 100 days in a row to make meaningful projects for myself and work.

# Day1 
A random name generator.  It uses a lot of very basic priniciples to create a name from the variables using the input function in python.

# Day2
Create multiple applications to show a working knowledge of Data types.  In addition to the working knowledge make useful conversion and calculations tools for use.

# Day3
An example of the Single Responsibility Principle in python with classes.  Save the file to the master directory not the Day3 folder, this is done on purpose.

# Day4
An example of the Open-Closed Principle.
